# git-practice

This repo is meant to be forked by students for a simple git basics exercise.

# Steps to follow

1. Fork this repo by clicking on the fork button at the top right corner.

2. Clone this repository by using the `git clone <repo address>` command. You can find the repo address by clicking on the green `Code` button on the main page of the repo. Make sure to get the address of YOUR FORK, not this repo (such that you have acccess rights to push to it).

3. Add any file in the cloned folder. Let's say `hello.py` and add any code to it.

4. Ask git to track this file by adding it to git's index: `git add hello.py`

5. Commit your changes `git commit hello.py -m "Add simple python code"`

6. Make another change to `hello.py` and commit again
7. Push your changes using `git push`; Voila! If you go back to your repo on github, you should see the commit history of your changes.
